The Digital Object Architecture was designed to enable all types of information, be it 
public, private, or some combination of the two, to be managed in a network over
potentially long time frames. It includes the capability for integrated public key
management within the same infrastructure used to manage other information. Any
information expressed in digital form can be securely managed within the architecture.
