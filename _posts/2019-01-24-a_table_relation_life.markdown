Table Relationships can easilly be compared to the relationship between family members. Each member would have thier own database table, but they are all related to one another. A single cell for each parent, connected to eachother, and then each connected to thier child in a seperate cell. This can also be expanded by having multiple children because then they would each have a cell both parents would be connected to, and a different reltionship connection to each sibling they have.
