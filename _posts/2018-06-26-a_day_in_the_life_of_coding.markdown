This blogging thing isn't something I have done before, so if these first few seem odd it's all just part of my learning system. 

I didn't realize how much coding effected how I do my job, or how any program I use at work relies on some form of code. In this technology driven world we live in most of our jobs (most of them) rely on computers in more than one way. I buy cars for a living, which is a weird concept I know, but it's how I make money. I won't go into the exact details of what my current job details but I do have to use computers the entire time. 

It's cool discovering all the different ways coding is connected to the job I have now. A job that on the surface has nothing to do with coding. 

I've been digging into learning how to code for the last two months and I can see code everywhere now. I realize there must be someone who built the original code for the databases my company uses to buy cars. The pricing must be plugged in somehow, there has to be some code that will spit out results for differnet types of cars. Then I started thinking about all the other factors you have to consider when buying a car. Just imagine this...

The code will have to filter every car based on
1. Make
2. Model
3. Year
4. Color
5. Miles
6. Physical Condition
7. Accident Reports
8. Retail Price
9. Wholesale Price
9.5 Auction reports to support wholesale pricing
10. Consumer Demand for the car of that fills in all of the previous filters

And on and on it could go. But this code exist! It's like a real thing that allows my company to calculate the value of an persons car. In no way is the car industry an exact science, but this code that we use is amazing and complex. Now I don't have access to study the code we use for pricing, ever now and then with down time I pull up the source and look at what is behind the scenes of our programs we use. I'm still too green to coding to completely understand what I'm looking at as a whole but it's always exciting when I go to look at a part of the source I've seen before and realize I understand something I didn't the last time I looked at it.
